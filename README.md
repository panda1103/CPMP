# CPMP: Cyclic Peptide Membrane Permeability Prediction Using Deep Learning Model Based on Molecular Attention Transformer  
The CPMP model is a deep learning approach for predicting the membrane permeability of cyclic peptides. Built on the Molecular Attention Transformer (MAT) neural network, CPMP achieves high determination coefficients (RÂ²) of 0.67 for PAMPA, 0.75 for Caco-2, 0.62 for RRCK, and 0.73 for MDCK permeability predictions.
